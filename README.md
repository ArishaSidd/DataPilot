# DataPilot

**Interactive AI-powered platform for exploring credit card customer data, visualizing trends, and predicting churn in real-time using ML models.**

---

## Project Highlights

- **Built & deployed** a Streamlit-based app to **upload datasets**, explore data, visualize trends with **Plotly**, and obtain **real-time churn predictions** using ML models.  
- Achieved **97.2%+ accuracy** on customer attrition using ensemble models (**XGBoost, Random Forest, AdaBoost**) fine-tuned with **GridSearchCV** and a **ColumnTransformer preprocessing pipeline**.  
- Embedded an **LLM-powered AI assistant (LLaMA-4 via Groq API)** to answer questions about churn logic, code snippets, and graph explanations — enhancing usability for both technical and non-technical users.
